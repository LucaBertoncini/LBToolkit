# LBToolkit
Swiss-army toolkit for FreePascal developers: thread-safe classes, event systems, file utilities and a reactive logging engine UI integration. Lightweight, extensible, and non-intrusive

**LBToolkit** is a modular and extensible collection of units crafted to simplify multithreaded programming, event handling, file operations, and robust logging for desktop, service, and embedded applications.

It includes:

### üîß Core Utilities (`src/utils/`)
Reusable components that power multiple projects:
- `uEventsManager.pas`: event dispatching system with flexible signatures
- `uLBBaseThread.pas`: lifecycle-aware thread class with auto-nulling references
- `uLBCalendar.pas`: Module for converting between UTC and local time with full support for historical Daylight Saving Time (DST) rules
- `uLBFileUtils.pas`: advanced file operations, size estimation, search
- `uLBTimers.pas`: timing tools including interruptable sleep and high-precision delays
- `uSharedMemoryManagement.pas`: shared memory manager for fast IPC communication with external processes
- `uTimedOutCriticalSection.pas`: thread-safe access with timeout protection

These utilities form a "Swiss army knife" of functionality across all LBToolkit projects.

### üìù LBLogger System (`src/LBLogger/`)
A reactive, asynchronous and customizable logging platform:
- Queue-based logging with background thread dispatch
- Dynamically attachable sub-loggers (`TLBBaseLogger`) ‚Äî no changes to existing code
- Built-in visual loggers for desktop apps: `TMemoLogger`, `TLabelLogger`, `TStatusBarLogger`
- External loggers: system `eventlog` via `TfpEventLogger`
- Message filtering by module, content, or severity
- Non-invasive alerting platform with modular reactions to error patterns (`#ERR#`)

### üåê LBmicroWebServer (`src/LBmicroWebServer/`)
Minimalistic HTTP server with embedded control hooks and dynamic routing support. Designed for fast integration into services and automation pipelines.

- Lightweight HTTP 1.1 engine ‚Äî zero external dependencies  
- Customizable request handler via `OnRequest` event  
- POST/GET routing with structured URI parsing  
- Ideal for service endpoints, webhooks, remote scripting, or embedded dashboards

---

### üîÅ LBWebPyBridge (`src/LBWebPyBridge/`)
Modular bridge between Pascal and Python, enabling script-driven microservices with shared memory efficiency.

- Executes Python scripts dynamically from Pascal via persistent workers  
- Communication handled through high-speed shared memory (no file I/O or sockets)  
- Script selection based on HTTP URIs (e.g., `/tests/AppHello/main ‚Üí main.py`)  
- Supports independent application folders with modular imports  
- Built-in orchestrator assigns requests to available Python threads  
- Seamless integration with LBmicroWebServer for POST/GET delegation  
- Test suite included for both Pascal and Python sides  

Ideal for extending Pascal-based applications with Python logic ‚Äî from AI modules to complex computation ‚Äî without recompiling the server or introducing overhead.

### ‚úÖ Architecture Highlights

- **Incremental extension of features**
- **Granular control over message handling**
- **Extreme maintainability and runtime configurability**
