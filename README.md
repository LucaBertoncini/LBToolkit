# LBToolkit

A modular, reactive and thread-safe architecture toolkit for systems programming and automation.

It is a swiss-army toolkit for FreePascal developers: thread-safe classes, event systems, file utilities and a reactive logging engine UI integration. Lightweight, extensible, and non-intrusive.

---

## Features

- **Thread-safe synchronization** via `TTimedOutCriticalSection` (critical section with timeout support)
- **Event dispatching system** with flexible callback signatures
- **Structured logging engine** with optional UI integration
- **File utilities** for recursive operations and size estimation
- **Timers and delays** with interruptable sleep and precision control
- **WebSocket client** with RFC 6455 support and automatic ping/pong
- **Minimal HTTP server** with path-based routing, a customizable pipeline of request handlers (to easily extend it into an HTTP gateway or middleware engine) and built-in support for WebSocket connections
- **Shared memory manager** for IPC with external processes
- **Virtual keyboard component** for UI automation and input simulation (`LBVirtualKeyBoard`)
- **Python bridge**: an HTTP server extension that dispatches JSON POST requests to URI-mapped Python scripts, organized in folders and executed via a managed pool of Python processes (`LBWebPyBridge`)

---

## Tested Platforms

- Linux (x86_64, ARM)
- Windows (64-bit)

Other platforms may be compatible via FreePascal, but are not currently tested.

---

## Design Principles

- **Modularity**: each unit is independent and reusable
- **Thread safety**: concurrency is handled explicitly and predictably
- **Minimal dependencies**: no external libraries required beyond FreePascal, Ararat Synapse and OpenSSL
- **Extensibility**: components are designed to be subclassed or replaced

## Examples & Demos

LBToolkit includes several practical examples embedded in its test suites and demo folders:

- `LBLogger`: see `LazTest` project for a GUI demo of reactive logging
- `LBVirtualKeyboard`: explore the `Demo/` folder for a working keyboard interface
- `LBWebPyBridge`: includes a complete test suite for both Pascal and Python sides

These examples are designed to be minimal, focused, and directly runnable.
