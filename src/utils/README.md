# LBToolkit â€” Utils Module

This folder contains reusable system-level units that support multiple projects within LBToolkit.

## ðŸ“¦ Included Units

### ðŸ”¹ uLBBaseThread.pas
A lifecycle-aware thread class with safe termination, critical section handling, and multi-reference cleanup.

- Ensures thread closure with `Terminate` + `WaitFor`
- Manages external references via `RegisterReference`
- Suitable for daemon-like background workers

> **Note for inheritance:**  
> Classes deriving from `TLBBaseThread` should call `inherited Destroy` **before** releasing their local resources to ensure safe thread finalization.

### ðŸ”¹ uEventsManager.pas
An event broadcasting system supporting multiple listeners.

### ðŸ”¹ uLBTimers.pas
Timing tools including interruptable sleep and high-precision delays.

### ðŸ”¹ uLBFileUtils.pas
Utilities for file operations, folder size calculation and recursive discovery.
